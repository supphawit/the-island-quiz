# The Island Quiz

**Developer:** Supphawit Wuttiprasit

The Island Quiz is a game application built with Next.js and TypeScript. It allows users to play a trivia quiz game with questions and answers. Players can track their performance, replay the game, and continue their session later if they navigate away.

## Features

### 1. Start Game Button
- Clicking the "Start" button creates a new session and navigates to the question-answering screen.

### 2. Question and Answer Screen
- Displays the question and a set of 2â€“4 answer choices (based on the API response).
- When the user selects an answer, the result of the answer is shown, and the user can proceed to the next question using the "Next" button.

### 3. Timing Feature
- Tracks the time spent on each question and sends it along with the answer.

### 4. Game End
- When all questions are answered, the API will return `null` to indicate the test is complete.
- Displays the results of the game when the test ends.

### 5. Replay Game
- After displaying the results, a "Continue" button allows the user to return to the home screen.
- Starting a new game creates a new session.

### 6. Session Continuation
- If the user navigates away from the question screen before completing the test, they can continue the current session when they return.

### 7. Local Player History
- Stores the player's name and score history locally on the device.
- Includes a History button that allows the user to view their past game results.
